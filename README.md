## Sources?

Fontstruct allows only to export the font as a file for GlyphApp, which I do not have as it's paid and only available on MacOS,
so I can't have a look at it. That's why they aren't available on this repo. If you want these sources files, contact me by mail
(see my [GitHub profile page](https://github.com/Corne2Plum3))
